The noodles and rice dishes on the other hand were a bit of a disappointment, and worth giving a pass. Their special beef in a peppery sauce (at the end of the menu) is also definitely worth a try! Pricewise, it is rather pricey - we had a sampling of sushi, sashimi, and tempura, a hot dish, and two non-alcoholic cocktails and the bill came up to \u00a354 for the two of us! Luckily, we had the TasteCard, which gives 50% off - after the discount, it was an absolute bargain. Ukai is a really great place to bring a date as the atmosphere is seductive, and they have a lounge upstairs to get more drinks after the meal. Unfortunately, the tables downstairs are placed quite close to one another, which doesn't afford much privacy while dining.

{"review_id": "3_19", "text": "There isn't anything special about the Diner, but that's kind of the point; it serves standard, unsophisticated food for relatively cheap prices. There are highlights, like the peanut butter milkshake, but ultimately this is a place you go for no-fuss fare that comes exactly as you expect it to. The \"Diner Veggie Cheese Burger\" (\u00a37.95) is large for the price, though it doesn't come with fries and falls apart upon even the lightest touch. The fries are offered eight different ways, with standard \"French Fries\" priced at \u00a32.75 and \"Diner Fries\" at \u00a32.95, the 20p getting you a light dusting of cajun spice. I've had the Diner Fries at a few locations and here they were dusted the lightest, with maybe one in five fries covered. The \"The Big V Dog\" (\u00a35.95) is another entree option, though note when the menu says it's a \"straight up vegan hot dog topped with French's mustard,\" it means it. The vegan sausage is about eight inches long and is placed in a hoagie bun with a dousing of mustard; that's it. I understand the price is low, but the fact that toppings that would normally come standard on a hot dog (cheese, pickles, onions) are \u00a31.00 extra is slightly odd. Similarly, any dips beyond mustard and ketchup are also an extra \u00a31.00 and quite small for even that price. Ultimately, the Diner stands out as a dependable chain for comfortable interiors and consistent food, though this location had some hiccups. The wait staff tended to my booth from a walkway below it (you'd have to see it), rather than coming to stand next to the table. Perhaps they didn't want to get too close to the front door, which was propped open and allowed for cigarette smoke to freely waft inside. It also took an unusually long time to get the bill, as the staff were preoccupied with chatting amongst themselves at the bar by the till. I'll go back, but I'll expect a little less.", "stars": 3}

I grew up going to the Rainforest Cafe in Orlando, so I wanted to relive the nostalgia while I was in London. It did not live up to my expectations. When you enter the cafe, you arrive at the gift shop. When you make your way to the back, after dodging unsupervised children throwing stuffed animals and climbing on the displays, you receive a \"passport\" with a time on it. We waited about 30 minutes upstairs before our time came around and we were directed downstairs where we turned in our passport and waited another half hour before being seated. The ambiance of this place is really neat. I felt like I was actually dining in the jungle. Unfortunately, this jungle came with a whole bunch of kids running around the dining room. Throughout my meal, I had kids I didn't know climbing on my chair and running circles around my table. While I appreciate that this is a family friendly establishment, it is a dining room, not a playground. I wish the staff would have enforced a little more order. The menu is standard tourist trap fare and not high quality. The vegetarian options are almost nonexistent. Our waiter, Giancarlo, was pleasant and got us in and out quickly. I appreciate his efficiency. Overall, my recommendation is to skip all of the restaurants in Leicester Square.

Basically we had dark meat chicken with a bone in it and the meat looked as though it was not the highest quality. Not great tasting either. We tried the beef and it was just ok but very fatty. Overall we tried three meats, and had some cheesy rolls to the tune of 60 pounds for two people! Oh, the best part. We are checking out and I notice that there is a \"cover charge\" on the bill. What is that about? At no point in time did I see a sign for this and nor did I consent to this charge. It was before 8 PM and last time I checked this wasn't a bar.I asked the man checking us out who just dismissed it and said \"its okay.\" Um no, its not. I should not be paying a 6 pound cover charge to eat non-salad in a half full restaurant. Then, he asked me for my passport and to write down the passport # on the receipt?!

Their menu was specialized around mussels, but I went for a sharing concept with my brothers between the Pork Belly, Beef Carbonara and Liege Meatballs, all of which were accompanied with potato stomp.The pork belly was okay tasting, but nothing special. The beef and meatballs however were really good! The portions were unfortunately quite small, and I felt like I left the restaurant hungrier than when I entered it. For me personally, this is always a huge dissapointment whenever going out somewhere to eat. If I were to go again, I'd rather go for the mussels.

The frites and beers were simply spectacular (Rochefort 10 is one of my all time favorites).

Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment.

Two dishes I typically use to judge a dim sum place are: the rice noodle rolls and the baos (quality of the noodle crepe and the dough, respectively). One of my friends ordered the rice noodle roll with youtiao (\u6cb9\u6761). The noodle crepe was perfectly steam and thin. And, the noodle roll had a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds which added another layer of fragrance. The char shao bao was flavorful in its stuffing (Chinese BBQ pork) and the exterior was soft and wasn't dry. We ordered a couple other dishes as well such as chicken feet in black bean sauce and duck tongue. Both were great as well in terms of flavor. The food and atmosphere reminds me of dim sum tea houses in Hong Kong with a bustling staff, Cantonese dramas playing on flat screens, and the tables set with white tea cups.

This happened to be Bertorelli directly opposite. Convenient. We wandered in and were seated immediately, presented with menus and delivered a healthy selection of breads, which we dominated. The menu is extremely pizza and pasta focused, but there are some speciality dishes i.e. chicken and beef etc. Check out the Menu - bit.ly/atJ1EO . After such a promising start the staff took an age to take our order, and considering they weren't rammed, it was a little frustrating. I went with chicken livers to start and chicken cooked in red wine and my Dad went with a fried seafood mess and a seafood ravioli. The starters were delicious and had enough to them to satisfy our ravenous appetites. \u00a0I was a cheeky warm up for the main courses. My chicken number was full of flavour and the smoked panchetta complemented the dish perfectly. The only down side was that I think they must have picked an anorexic chicken for me to dine on because it was bonier than your average skeleton. My dad's was satisfied with his main, but because they were on a tomato rampage, it killed off the delicate flavours of the lobster and the crab. Disappointing really as both looked the part my failed the taste test. We finished up with a tiramisu and a panna cotta \u00a0both of which made up for the let down in the main course. The Irish coffee was also excellent. In terms of pricing the food is probably about \u00a33/4 too expensive for what it is. \u00a390 for two people is quite a lot (considering we only had two glasses of red wine).

I seemed to be the food consultant of the evening, explaining that, yes, porridge was indeed savoury, er yes I guess it's sort of like rice pudding, and that Singapore noodles is a phony dish. The latter is fried vermicelli noodles with curry powder, which is virtually served no where in Singapore. This dish is like improvised mi-fen with the wrong ingredients within reach of the chef. It is a legit, edible and tasty dish, though. I got a simple beef porridge (a.k.a 'congee') with peanuts which tasted good and authentic, although no porridge can ever surpass my mum's home-made beef porridge.The restaurant served the staple deep-fried appetizers such as spring rolls and prawn toast, which were not too popular in Southeast-Asian menus.Overall, the food was tasty and not a bad quality, with reasonable prices and lots of helpful staff walking around. We were served free slices of really good, juicy orange after the meal. Loon Tao is definitely a reliable place to go in Chinatown.", "stars": 3}

It was nice to reminisce with my partner about the movie and its messages while people watching in Leicester Square (we sat on the lower level).All in all, an A-OK meal.

B\u00f3 Drake combines everything I love about Asian food, from the sweetness of the pickled kimchi to the succulent seafood, with the rustic smoky flavor of European barbeque. Before I even talk about the food we enjoyed, I have to mention the quality of the service. From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant, we were greeted with smiling, friendly faces. We were promptly seated at a cozy table, and really made to feel welcome. Our server went above and beyond to ensure that we were enjoying ourselves.The portion sizes were perfect, and so incredibly tasty. We started with appetizers, the KFC - Korean Fried Chicken was tender and juicy on the inside, and crispy on the outside. The sticky glaze of soy garlic, grapes, and rosemary added the right amount of sweetness. We split the pork belly bao, a piece for each of us, and the pickled cucumber and soy glazed peanuts brought the dish up a notch.For our mains, we tried the smoked rib stack, which was smoked with a sweet chestnut wood and covered in an Asian inspired BBQ sauce. These ribs were unlike any I've had before, and were cooked to perfection. We then had the Sirloin Tataki, in which the meat has been aged for 35 days, and served with ponzu, truffled shitake, and tofu cream. Magnificent!I couldn't pass up dessert, and opted for the sesame oil soft serve ice cream, which was rich and delicious, with a hint of nuttiness from the toasted sesame seeds on top. B\u00f3 Drake came highly recommended to me, and now I highly recommend it!", "stars": 5}

This is growing trend which I hope augurs for Malaysian food in Britain - a lot of Chinese restaurants are adding supplementary sections to their main menus offering South East Asain specials.Laksa is one of my favourite one bowl hawker (street food) meals. You get eiether egg noodles or rice vermicelli noodles with meat,seafood and vegetables in a coconut curry broth. As with other broth based dishes like Vietnamese pho, it stands on the broth. Proper laksa should be rich, deep with aromatics like candlenuts adding flavour alongside heat from chilliSadly, Hing Loon's version had the top notes but was rather thin and too dilute to add the depth and layers that characterises a top class laksa.I was a bit disappointed that they had already run out of my chosen starter of dragon whisker prawn at 1.15pm - described as prawn wrapped in peach, served with sweet sour sauce, it would have been a new dish for me.I also had a side order of siu loong bau - the wrapper was too thick and the soup had leaked out.I'm awarding them 3 stars because the laksa was \u00a35.20, a good price for the heart of tourist West End", "stars": 3}

We have been to countless Chinese restaurants in the last 30 some years. I only write reviews on yelp when I feel strongly about it.The service was horrible. The lady on the 2nd floor who took our order had no smile, and did not try to help at all with our order when the first two items we wanted were not available. Maybe it was because we did not order any drinks when she asked about it, so we won't spend enough for her service? She was smiling to customers at the next table who ordered big dishes plus a bottle of wine. We were just there for a meal after a day of sightseeing. However we did expect to be treated like customers.Our dishes came without rice (the server did not ask if we wanted rice). We were not sure why, so we waited. Finally after about 10 minutes we asked a nearby male server about the rice. He said it does not come with the dishes so we ordered two bowls. We waited again. The male server apparently put in the order but forgot getting the rice. We saw him busy helping others to get wine glasses from the top of a shelf. We waited until he came by to remind him about the rice. We eventually got the rice 7-8 minutes after we ordered it. We ate only one bowl because the amount was ample in each bowl and it was overcooked and mushy. The two bowls of rice was \u00a36.40, \u00a33.20 a small bowl. That is pricy. In the US, only lower level, inexpensive Chinese restaurants charge rice separately, maybe $1 for a bowl. High end and nicer ones do not charge you for rice. So that was also a bit strange. For the quality of food I give it 3 stars, and the service 0 star. How could they mess up the steamed rice so badly but still charge for a premium price? We will be in London for a few more days.

That's all. So we've come all the way from Birmingham to have a really amazing time out and we are presented with a list of three exceptionally low-value starters to choose from, and six incredibly mediocre mains.\"Two courses for 14.95\" it says at the top of the menu; so when we expressed our disappointment to who I presume was the manager, we were told \"it's paid for whether you eat or not\" and \"if you want anything from the main menu you'll have to pay full price.\" Can we take the thirty quid value and use it to buy stuff from the main menu? \"No, the system won't let us, it doesn't work like that,\" and so on. So basically we settled for what we would have chosen from the choices available and discussed how we would never come here again.The most shocking part of the whole experience was that we were told in no uncertain terms that they \"get this all the time\" and were even told that there was a coeliac disease suffer dining and that she wasn't able to have anything at all from the menu because none of it was gluten free, and that the diner was made to pay full price for the salmon dish which was gluten free!So, the actual food. The starters were boring and small, the mains were boring and large. I left half of my \"proscitto e funghi\" (ham and mushroom) pizza because in essence the ham was just draped over the top of it and wasn't really part of the meal. My other half left half of her carbonara because it was boring. Such a disappointing experience. We were half-heartedly offered the desserts menu but as we'd already decided not to spend another penny here we quickly declined and paid no more than we needed to in order to exit the building, then began the short walk to TGI Friday's to have some cocktails and dessert.Prezzo - pull your finger out and either serve the amazing food that we've heard you do to ALL of your patrons, or break your deal with the voucher system because it is actually doing you more harm than good in its current format.

Served with potatoes and creamy leeks. The leeks were the most flavourful part of this dish. The chicken schnitzel was too dry. This is the thing with schnitzel, easy to end up dry and for these prices I expect more. Chef needs to pound it more and control the heat better. Just a piece of chicken really, but the skill in making it is in the temperature and time to make it succulent. Served with no sauce. No one wants a dry chicken meal. The fries were not seasoned, but I guess I can do that myself. The bread pudding was a modern twist on this poor mans classic dessert. All desserts overpriced. Made of brioche, orange marmalade, dry fruit. Server told me I can have any but one desserts due to my nut allergy, but half of those had nuts in the description.

Wasn't making money? Religious? I have no idea, but it would have been nice to be told before we went in. Their website still shows alcohol, (wine / beer / etc). Anyway, food was pretty dire, nothing different to what people have written above, so I won't bore the review with it. What a shame, I love Malysian.

But maybe if knew a place that sell high cuts of meat for a good price, found the time to cut it, marinate it, have a big enough fridge to rest it all and and then an indoor smokeless barbecue then maybe I might consider. I don't so I come here. Plus it's pretty romantic. I cook for you and you cook for me... *heart melts*I use to go to Kintan to satisfy my BBQ cravings but sadly Kintan, I've found somewhere better. Superstar BBQ serves higher quality of food across their whole menu and not just focusing on their barbecue meats but also their small dishes. Their service is also quicker. The only thing I want to complain out is the cold draft coming in making it extremely difficult to tolerate. Even when the barbecue was on, it didn't warm us up. On to our food...We started with a pot of green tea which turns out to be genmaicha (roasted brown rice green tea). It was a lovely surprise. Soothing and warming!Five pieces of KFC in sweet soy Where a lot of Kintan's small dishes were uninspiring and bland, Superstar places a lot of attention to detail on their small plates. Their fried chicken for example was amazing. It didn't look like much at first with a little sauce drizzled here and there. But the batter was light and airy, seasoned perfectly and covering lovely succulent pieces of chicken. Japchae Everyone is raving on about the japchae and they have every reason to. The glass noodles were silky, sticky and full of bounce, stir fried in a lovely sweet soy and sesame oil marinate. We ordered the vegetable version instead of the other beef option and there was a lovely mix of crunchiness and softer textures. Very delicious.MandooIt is as good as dumplings can get. The skin was crisp on one side from being grilled yet soft and thin on the other side, incasing a lovely juicy pork meatball that was bursting with flavour from the addition of greens mixed in. Seafood pajeon Seafood pa jeon unfortunately was more like vegetable pa jeon. There was barely any seafood in sight, maybe the occasional baby shrimp. It was a little thinned out and more dense than I prefer but the flavours were fine.Yuk hwae. I adored the beef tartare and how wonderfully slippery and fresh it was. The meat was tender, springy with lovely balanced flavours of sweetness from the juicy pear and the creamy yolk.Rib galbi Recommended throughout social media these did not disappoint. It was enriched with a lovely sweet savoury marinate, beautifully tender and juicy.Wine pork These however were disappointing being quite bland and chewy. I couldn't taste the wine either.Speciality marinated lambThese were incredibly tasty. The marinate brought in so much flavour and depth. It is just as tender as the rib galbi but even sweeter in taste.Chicken boolgogi These came as thigh meat which were much to my preference being more flavoursome and tender in general. \u00a0They were also well seasoned so you can taste the flavours throughout the whole chicken. Lettuce and miso paste These were to wrap the meats after they were cooked. But I found the choice of lettuce they used kind of poor as they were rougher and denser compared to, let's say the round lettuce, which masked a lot of the softer texture and flavour of the meat. The miso paste however helped bring out more flavour.Galbi TangA great way to wash down all the food was a type of Korean clear beef soup that had a generous portion of beef brisket stewing in it for hours creating a rich and soothing broth, full of flavour and perfect for a cold winter's day.Honey quince shaved iceWe ordered one of their infamous shaved ice that is quite pricey for \u00a36.95. It was lovely with the grated syrup orange peel, which balanced out with the sweet condensed milk, sour plum, honey and the shaved ice itself that took away the sickliness.I was really surprised about how good Superstar BBQ was as their uncreative name does not help. I suppose you should never judge a book by its cover.

I saw the bartender waving at us. \u00a0He caught my eye and gave me both the \"we'll be right with you\" and the \"please\" signs from across the room. \u00a0This was enough for me to nod and we waited.A server came over a few seconds later and asked us how many. \u00a0We said two and she gave us two menus and asked for us to wait while they cleared a table for us. \u00a0It turns out they were prepping for a group of eight that would walk in the door right after we were seated. \u00a0I can appreciate that, as long as I'm not ignored. \u00a0Good work!Being from the US, we didn't know Prezzo was a chain, but it was pretty good food. \u00a0We had some olives and some bread to start. \u00a0The drinks were pretty good. \u00a0I had something extremely girly with berries & fizzy bubbles in it that my wife teased me about and she had a nice glass of wine. \u00a0My drink was really good and I'm more of a beer guy mostly.I had the Vesuvio pizza and the wife had the spaghetti carbonara. \u00a0Both of us enjoyed our choices. \u00a0The server made sure that I was aware my choice was spicy/hot and said they could make it with sweet peppers instead. \u00a0I declined and thanked her for the warning. \u00a0It had both great flavor and the promised heat. \u00a0I often complain about places failing to deliver heat when they promise it, but this did. \u00a0Excellent heat and it wasn't just hot, it was flavorful.We had good service, although, we've traveled enough to know that you don't get American-style service in either Europe or the UK.Good location. \u00a0Good d\u00e9cor. \u00a0Good food. \u00a0I'd go again.", "stars": 4}

This particular restaurant is massive and light and airy, plenty of room for large groups celebrating an occasion. To put it in context there were 17 in our group and we only took up a tiny section of this restaurant. I ordered Pollo Forzo - described as a fiery pizza; chicken marinated in smoky chilli powder, garlic and dried chilli flakes with chargrilled red & yellow peppers, roquito peppers, mozzarella and tomato, finished with Gran Moravia cheese, parsley and chilli oil - and whilst it was delicious on a fantastically thin base, fiery it wasn't. I added extra chilli oil. I realise there is a happy balance, but if you're describing it as fiery, a little more chilli is required. Saying that, that was the only criticism.

(Based on a friend's recommendation, we tried a nearby restaurant in Piccadilly called Yoshino, which offers a good lunch menu -- and its tea and miso soup and service are all far better than at Ikeda.) But the main reason for the rating above is that we were turned away in late August when we showed up for a confirmed lunch booking due to a renovation project which had run over. Ikeda had our contact details, but we received no voice mail and no email from the restaurant advising of the works overrun. (One of the staff said he \"tried to call\" me, but my phone shows no record of having received an attempted call, and there was in any event no voice mail left.) Given the advanced state of technology options today, it is shocking Ikeda did not deliver a message to us about the closure. Instead, all we got was a perfunctory apology -- not even an offer to rebook us on a future date. I sent them an email detailing our experience which they did not even acknowledge. Very disappointing. Given this unsatisfactory attitude, we cannot recommend this restaurant.", "stars": 1}

After we were seated, we were brought some sort of small tuna appetizer. Then we ordered some sushi, sake and edamame. The sushi was OK, not mind-blowing by any means, yet very very expensive. When we got our bill, we saw that we were charged 2 pounds for the tuna appetizer that we did not order. We were also charged 2 pounds for the water we ordered with our meal - which was regular tap water brought in two tiny glasses. Seriously? 2 pounds for each glass of water? The following week after i got back to the U.S., I checked my credit card bill and found out they charged me twice for my meal.

They had lots of tables (at least 20), and only 3 or 4 seemed to actually have people dining at them.I think the main reason why my dad was ok with staying at this restaurant was because they had a giant projector where they were playing Wimbledon. My dad is a huge tennis player (we actually came to London to go to Wimbledon this year), so he basically just sat and watched the screen the whole time.Decor is somewhat trendy, and had a lounge feeling to it.

Our waiter was ok, but he had a really thick accent and I felt like we both had a hard time communicating with each other. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri and I felt like he had no clue wtf I said. When he told the bartender they made one for me, but it was almost like some sort of martini when I had expected it to be a strawberry blended drink... I sent it back and just opted with a Coke because it was much less of a hassle.I ordered this massive English burger which came with a LOT of stuff on it. Too much, in fact, that it was nearly impossible to eat the burger in a somewhat tidy way. Out of all the burgers I've eaten in my life, that particular burger goes down as one of, if not THE messiest, burger I've ever had. Everything kept spilling out of it, and even when I divided it into four pieces I still had a hard time eating it. My dad got a steak which came with an egg on top and a side of fries/chips. He didn't really comment on the food, so I'm assuming it was just mediocre, or he was too engrossed in the tennis match on TV that he didn't have much to say otherwise.The prices were a little expensive...I think my burger was just under 20 pounds and it was one of the cheaper items on the menu.Overall...I think this restaurant may just be starting out, and really needs a lot of polishing to do. I found out that it's a chain, so maybe this particular location just hasn't been around for awhile because everyone seemed rather awkward and inexperienced. I will most likely not return.", "stars": 2}

We went to the location on Villiers street off the Strand and loved it. The place was really big and the upstairs section was roomy and quiet (which was nice for my grandfather). So, on one of our last nights in the city we decided to try the restaurant again but at a different location (this one). Our experience was completely different...The customer service at this location was so poor. We sat down and waited for a server to come see us for a long time. We asked one of the servers if we had to go up to the front of the restaurant to order and they told us no so we stayed seated only to be told 15 minutes later that we had to order at the front counter. When we went up to order, it was extremely difficult to get the attention of one of the servers at the bar. Once our food was ordered, it again took incredibly long to come. In addition, we were seated right next to where they kept the utensils so the whole night all we heard were the servers throwing the utensils into the bin (one bang after another). Drinks were spilt, it was so loud, and there was no attempt to make the customers feel welcome. The food was good. I had the burger and it was really tasty. My parents had the 5-plate combo and they enjoyed it as well. It was a nice concept because they got to try a bit of everything (sausages, calamari, chicken wings, and chili tacos). Unfortunately, since this place is a chain, the food doesn't make up for the terrible experience. You can get the same food at any other location.

Considering its in covent garden we were excited to have a date night around that area. We were a little let down to find out that the cafe des amis restaurant and bar were two different things. To use the voucher we had to go to the bar, eventhough the restuarant was REALLY empty. So we went down in the basement to the bar. It was not a typical date night ambiance. After we set down and ordered our meals we really felt like the service was really rushed. For the appetizers we ordered the steak tartare and the fried squid. They were tasty but the plates came out like 3 minutes after we ordered! Talk about speedy! For the main course i got fish n chips and my boyfriend got the shrimp linguini. The meals were tasty. Usually the fish is battered when you order fish n chips but mine was not. However, it did taste fresh and lovely. Again, just like the appetizers, the meal came out extremly fast! We were out of there in like 40 minutes! This review really is mainly for using the vouchers at their restaurant.

{"review_id": "3_447", "text": "I'd heard of Marani, a family run Georgian tavern in Mayfair, from various sources, mainly because it had just opened, and a few reviews were making their way around the internet.So I decided to take my best friend on a Monday night to sample the fine Georgian cuisine (which I knew nothing about). I did no research or anything, I prefer to be surprised.It's located in the heart of Mayfair, so it was just perfect after an evening shopping on Regent Street :)Quite unassuming from the outside, the interiors are beautiful.Dimly lit, downstairs has a collection of paintings, murals and original pieces of furniture.We were greeted by a lovely waitress which took our coats (you get a Chinese fortune cookie style ticket for your coat which is cute) and we were shown to our table.Whilst she explained the menu, another waiter gave us a plate of freshly baked Georgian bread with butter (yummy), and explained that that's what you do in Georgia when you have guests.On to the food.The menus look a bit shoddy (they're pages put together with string), and prices vary from \u00a38 for a starter to \u00a315/25 for a main. You can have anything from broths to dumplings to veal's brain. The idea is that everything is shareable, so everything is served in the middle of the table.We ordered the typical dumplings, which you have to pick up, turn upside down, bite and suck the juice out before eating the meat, and a lamb stew with apricots and tarragon. All delicious.Wine is also excellent. There's a variety of wines from all over the country, but we opted for a Georgian red which was yummy.After our dinner, our waitress was kind enough to show us the rooms upstairs.I actually gasped. They hired a Georgian interior designer/artist to do it and it's a mix of quirky traditional furnishing and more contemporary takes on it. Also, check out the bathrooms, unbelievable!!Overall the food and wine were great, as was the service and location.My only observations are that a few hosting things need to fine tuned (waiters are a bit disorganised, but never rude!), but I'm sure that will come with more experience. \u00a0Also, some of the prices aren't quite right. One of our mains was \u00a315 and the other was \u00a324, and there was genuinely nothing that could justify the nearly \u00a310 difference in price.

We also have an astonishingly bad track record with picking places to eat (or failing to, usually walking along \"seeing what else we can find\" until we're too weak to move any more and just happy to sell our souls to Costa for a sandwich) so when I saw that there was a Brasserie Blanc on the roof of Covent Garden Market, I was thrilled! Sure, it's a chain, but I'd eaten in the Leeds one with my mum once and it'd been lovely.*side note to explain our terrible track record with London theatre: years ago, we booked for Lord of the Rings, but our tickets were moved by two weeks due to \"Aragorn\" breaking his leg. Strider no more. When we did make it down (with understudy in place), we got lost, missed the first five minutes, and became those horrible people who hate who come in late, heralded by an usher's torch.

Oh no! What had I done? In efforts to avoid our theatre curse had I doomed us to culinary misery?No.I feared attitude and snootiness: we were welcomed like old friends.I feared inattentive or careless service: our waiter was a delight, happy to make recommendations and to talk about our evening ahead (\"Oh, War Horse! I'd love to go; I've heard such good things!\")I feared substandard food: it was delicious. My ham hock terrine was garlicky heaven and a perfect mix of textures, and the pan-fried mushrooms for which my friend and I both opted were a fluffy delight in cheesy sauce.Add to this the fact that we were watching the evening light sweep over Russell Street from the roof of Covent Garden Market and it really couldn't have been less than four stars.

Usually, when a restaurant only takes cash or has a broken machine, they would let the customers know ahead of time. However, nothing indicated this. On top of the lousy service and mandatory 12.5% service charge, the waiter gave this fake appeal about how he gets none of the service fees and only cares that we enjoyed his service. He and probably the chef were the only ones there! Out of politeness, we gave him more tip.

We were going to a comedy show at The Top Secret Comedy Club across the street and hadn't gotten to the venue too early. We had been wanting to have some good Indian food since we arrive and decided to sit down and give it a try. They were not busy and there was only one other table in the restaurant occupied. We had been walking and asked for water while we looked at the menu. The waited told us they were out of \"water\" and we needed to buy the expensive bottled water. My husband is not a push over and demanded water. It took several requests from three different waiters. Everything request seemed to require a lot of back and forth or a different waiter coming to the table taking the same order. I wasn't as hungry as my husband and just wanted an appetizer so ordered samosas, one of my favorite foods. My husband ordered a tandoori chicken appetizer and an entree. Weirdly, the waiters kept coming back to take the same order. (As I stated, there was only one other table occupied and three waiters, so this was strange.) His order came and the color looked okay but was tasteless and rubbery. I took a bite since my order did not come. Rubber and no flavor. My order never came. My husband ordered curry. Again the colors looked okay. He said the flavor seemed okay but the meat was again very rubbery. They made a big deal about if he wanted naan or rice with his deal. It doesn't come with either. Everything is a la carte here. We waited and waited, still asking for water. Finally a waiter just dropped off a pitcher of water, never served it. When my husbands curry had finally come they served another dish, a bowl of something foul looking, watery and orange. I told them I never ordered that. They argued with me. \"Are you sure you didn't order this. Are you sure you ordered a samosa?\" I couldn't believe when I finally got my samosa if was one small samosa cut in half over inedible greens. Five pounds for that. I would occasionally look over and notice one of the waiters had taken a seat and was glaring at us. (By the way, the following day I had delicious samosas at the Greenwich Market, four of them for three and a half pounds.) It has always been my experience that even bad Indian food was good.

{"review_id": "3_472", "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. It's very handy as it's so close to both Embankment and Charing Cross train stations. I also loved the actual decor of this place, it had a cosy feel to it but a little too cosy and intimate as the tables are so close to each other, you get a little too acquainted to the neighbours on the next table! I wanted to catch up on some private gossip with my friend and this rather hindered it, especially when she announced she was pregnant and I gasped and the whole restaurant fell silent and looked at me (ok, so I exagerate a little but that's what happens on telly and I'm just trying to build a picture here)...anyways, I digress. Luckily I had read another review and was tipped off that the waiters promptly place bread and olives on your table and as is general custom in most restaurants, this is normally complimentary (as I didn't request them) but you are sneakily charged extra. Being wise to this, I told them to take them away. I like olives but it's the principle. So instead they get you with charging extra for potatoes and veg. None of the meat and fish dishes have it included in the menu. But after my grumbles, I did actually enjoy the food itself as I tucked into it with my elbows pinned in neatly to avoid taking someone else's eye out. The waiters were reasonably attentive and didn't have to wait for our food too long. Finally, to a more trival but important element - the loos, grotty, they really could do with a face lift (all 2 of them). All in all, it is a lovely little venue to eat tasty Italian food but take into account what I've mentioned. It has so much potential but I don't think the owners take full advantage of it and it could be so much better.", "stars": 2}

We came at 10am, and they are supposed to serve breakfast as from 9am. When we walked in, we were told that the kitchen wasn't ready. An hour after opening, seriously people? We weren't in a hurry so sat down and waited for the order to be taken. We ordered 2 orange juices and one full italian and one poached eggs on toast. It took 30 minutes for the food to arrive. A bit long considering we were the first ones there and the restaurant was empty. The Full italian was good but the \"toast\" was extremely hard, like old bread that's been heated up. The mushrooms were too salty and the bacon was slightly undercooked. The sausage was tasty but nothing you wouldn't find in a supermarket.Now, the poached eggs. I had two eggs on two pieces of \"toast\". Again the toast was more like old bread that has hardened and has been heated up. I am French and I always do that with old bread if I can't be bothered to go buy more so I am pretty sure that was what they did. The poached eggs were just served on toast with a pinch of chive but no butter no nothing which is actually good for the diet, but there was no salt either. Overall, not great, honestly nothing impressive and for the price. I could have had 2 course dinner for two for that price. I mean seriously people, this is just eggs, old bread, mushroooms and oranges. Here is the detail of the bill:2 Orange Juice - 6.501 full Italian - 9.50 1 Poached Eggs - 6 \u00a0Service charge (what service) - 2.75Now, 2 little eggs on old bread is 6 pounds. I know this is London but I could find cheaper anywhere, especially considering the fact that the bread was old. And 6.50 for two normal size glasses of orange juice.

The first dish was very small and it was cubes of chicken, it was ok. The raita was literally sour cream with some shaved cucumbers on top (Yuck).

We were brought some waters and some menus. The menu at Wildwood is unlike anything I've ever seen - it is broken down into five distinct sections making deciding much easier: starters, pizza, pasta, salads and grill. Each section has anywhere from four to seventeen options ranging in price from \u00a32.85 to \u00a316.75. There's also a variety of sides that one can order or choose from, seven in total. All in all, the menu is simple, affordable and there's a good balance between heavier and lighter dishes. There's nothing overly complicated in their menu but that's just fine by me - there's no need for anything complex, sometimes the best dishes are the less intricate ones.I personally decided to order the baked chicken pasta (\u00a39.50) which featured tomato sauce, creme fraiche and spring onions, topped with mozzarella and Italian ham.

It is frustrating to encounter as I feel that the quality of the food has the potential to be great yet it still comes up short in some instances and in other departments.The pizza is freshly rolled, prepared and cooked with a large fire oven at the back of the restaurant; this makes the toppings succulent and even the pizza crust crispy and desirable. The le casarecce pasta I tried was also deliciously fragrant and tough but not too tough.\u00a0However, whilst food may excel in some areas, in others it does not fare so well: their 'fresh juice' is poured out of sealed bottles, I found sizeable chunks of ice in my ice cream and the cannoli seemed hardened or perhaps too thick to begin with and stuffed with excess cream to compensate.\u00a0Yet the most disappointing of all in both my visits was the service that was not just lack-lustre but actually distressing. At my first visit my friend and I are beckoned into the restaurant late in the evening, sat at a cramped table and rushed to order. After ordering we are then told to change our order as they say they are about to close and only have a chef to cook pizzas and nought else. Later, after ordering dessert they also turn around and say they only have one dessert left and we have no choice. Upon my second visit the chef preparing the pizzas accidentally douses my friend with flour, another member of staff knocks against my chair whilst taking the rubbish out and no apology was offered by either culprit.\u00a0To sum up, Frateli la Bufala can serve good and well presented food (with the exception of a few flaws) whilst providing simple wooden furniture and a somewhat slap-dash service.

They opened the door before we had time to look at the menu and greated us (no pressure...)We walk in to a nice looking restaurant pretty much empty but decided to give it a try. When it was time to order, I took a prawn curry and my father took chicken tika massala as well as a steamed rice to share. He put more pressure for us to order more... My father said three times that we were going to order more if we were still hungry. After a very, very long wait, it finally came and it looked really good, looked...My prawn curry was close to tasteless, the prawns were overcooked and looked as if they were taken straight out of the freezer. The chicken was good but far from being incredible: I had tasted better from Marks and Spencers...As for the rice, I could have done the same myself. Since the portions weren't huge, we ordered veggies wich were seriously tasteless... It was over all bad. They pressured us a LOT to come in, to order more, to consider more food, too have more drinks, not a great atmosphere at all. The service is very bad, and I could have been better food myself. Very disappointed, I really do not advice you to go!", "stars": 1}

{"review_id": "3_521", "text": "We had dinner at Maze this evening. I'm a big fan of Gordan Ramsay, so it's really excited!! The location's nice, but the decoration's bit old fashion for me, maybe cause it's inside an hotel? The staff were very friendly and professional. We had seven course dinner at the sushi bar. The food were very creative and absolutely delicious, not something boring but I won't say it's like very very surprising. The bill was 155 gbp. Personally I take it as a very nice experience but not sure if I wanna come back again.", "stars": 3}
{"review_id": "3_522", "text": "Let me get a couple of things out of the way right up front: 1. I grade on a curve. If you're a pub I grade one way, if you're a fine restaurant I grade another. 2. I don't mind dropping 90 quid on a dinner if the experience makes it worthwhile. Unfortunately, this place disappoints on both counts. When I stopped at the desk I was offered the choice between Maze or sushi. I opted for sushi after being told the restaurant had just opened and was a first for Gordon Ramsay.Upon being seated at the sushi bar I was greeted by a very friendly waitress who highlighted the tasting menu, the ala carte and, most importantly, the cocktail menu. The cocktail menu wasn't anything overly special, and the in-house drinks were mostly vodka based so I went with a negroni. I moved on to the ala cart menu and made my selections of a snow crab \"salad\", a roll, and a few sashimi items. At this point I'd love to be able to refer you to the pictures I took. But the place was way too dark for pics sans flash. In fact, the place was too dark to see your food without a flashlight. When I go for sushi in a nice restaurant I expect to be able to see and enjoy the artistry - great sushi embodies the phrase \"eating with your eyes\". As for the sushi itself, it was great. Not amazing, but great. And that's really where the place falls flat. If they spent a little less time trying to be hip and a little more time on trying to be an amazing sushi restaurant they'd have something special. As it is, it's not worth the price tag.", "stars": 3}
{"review_id": "3_523", "text": "A delightful find, Kula cafe is a dessert place on James St (a side street beside Selfridges and off Oxford St). Now that warmer weather is finally here it is nice to know that there is a place such as this to serve ice cream, desserts and/or cool drinks whenever you are parched, hot, or needing dessert after a meal or amidst/after a long day of shopping. Having said that, they also serve hot milkshakes which is useful to know for the colder months.\u00a0The cookie madness sundae I had was thoroughly satisfying and the smoothie had all the pulp of fresh fruit, which is nice to see. However, there is some lack of refinement overall as plastic spoons are used, seating is cramped and there are small flies flying around in the darker spots of the cafe.\u00a0Still, with a good variety of desserts, cakes, ice creams, smoothies and fresh juices on offer in the centre of London, I'm glad that Kula cafe exists and can serve up a decent enough treat for us urban shoppers.", "stars": 3}

Who could barely speak English. There was a more \"senior\" guy bossing her around. Openly arguing with her. Very very loudly. He had a face like a slapped arse. No smiling.Took ten minutes for my Coke to arrive. The menu offered vegetable pasta - there wasn't any left. The menu offered olives - again, none left.I ordered bread/oil and the Marco Polo. Both were wholly unremarkable. After a 35 min wait. Marco Polo was thin, lacking in meat/sauce. Pasta heavy. I left cursing myself. And very late upon my return to the office. AVOID.", "stars": 1}
{"review_id": "3_529", "text": "The food was forgivably forgettable, but the SERVICE. The service was SO BAD. So incredibly bad.My companion and I wanted to get off our feet and grab at bite at a place with outdoor seating so we could people-watch. Bella Italia was close to his hotel and seemed to fit the bill. We sat without service for about 10 minutes while a waitress attended to the table next to us, so I stepped inside to make sure that we weren't supposed to check in with a hostess. A different waitress dismissed us, saying yes, we were in fact supposed to seat ourselves and that someone would be with us shortly. As we were without menus, I checked out the one that was posted on the side of the building and decided on an entree.When our waitress finally came to the table, I let her know that I was ready to order food as well, but she refused to take the order, only wanting our drink order. Her attitude was all sorts of rude, so I ordered a glass of wine in hopes it would make her tolerable. After another 15 minutes, HOORAY, she delivered the wine. She took my order and I didn't see her again for 45 minutes. At that point, I just wanted to cancel the order and pay for the wine. Our waitress finally walked out onto the patio and as I attempted to speak with her, she rolled her eyes, motioned to the Coke and the Marlboros in her hand, and said, \"I'm on break\".It was ridiculous. To the point of just being hilarious. Another server ended up coming by with the food and bringing my check. She was cool. Seemed like she was hip to the fact that her co-worker sucked. I wolfed down the mediocre portobello burger in about 5 minutes because I'd already wasted almost 2 hours there.If the young, dark-haired, girl is still working there, let her go.

There were some slight variations but ultimately one type to get and it was good. Not too salty broth, generous amount of toppings and satisfying.We got an order of broccoli and fried chicken on the side. Broccoli was cooked perfectly and went well with the sesame sauce. The fried chicken was a little dry so not as good as I've had before.Drink menu is decent from sake, beer and wine to cocktails and soda. Service was quick and friendly.

Definitely do not order the chicken wings, unless you just want to drink their sauce.", "stars": 2}
